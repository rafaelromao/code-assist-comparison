            <div class="summary-box">
                <p>Based on our comprehensive analysis of the leading enterprise-grade AI coding solutions in 2025, we recommend a
                    multi-faceted approach to tool adoption. Rather than a one-size-fits-all solution, we advocate for strategically
                    deploying a range of tools based on their unique strengths and the specific needs of different teams and projects.
                    This approach maximizes developer productivity and ROI by leveraging the best features of each tool in the
                    appropriate context.</p>
